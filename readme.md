# Destiny Data Utils

Destiny Data Utils is a library designed to make building third party applications around Destiny 2 easier. This project is an iteration on the front end code built for GuardianForge to download manifest data, assist with caching, and massage the data into a more developer-friendly format. More info coming soon.

> ⚠️ This project is in VERY early development and is likely to change frequently over the coming weeks.
